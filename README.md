# NBA Prediction Prompts for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25

**Instructions:**

1. **Prompt 1:**
   - Copy Prompt 1 into Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 with "Grounded with Google Search" toggled ON.
   - Leave temperature setting at 1.
   - Add the two playing teams and their odds at the bottom of the prompt.

2. **Execution:**
   - The output may stop around step 4 - if so, simply type "continue" and press ENTER.
   - Wait for Prompt 1's output to complete before proceeding.

3. **Prompt 2:**
   - Copy/paste Prompt 2 after completing Prompt 1.
   - This builds on Prompt 1's information to continue analysis and generate player predictions.

**Note:** Prompt 2 relies on data generated by Prompt 1.<br><br>

**Changelog: Prompt 2 - V4 (Compared to V3)**

**Date:** April 22, 2025

**Overall Goal:** This update (V4) builds upon V3 by incorporating feedback from multiple game prediction analyses. The primary focus is on increasing rigor in data acquisition (especially regarding timeliness and reliability), enhancing the analysis of injury/absence impact, refining the player stat prediction logic for greater realism (particularly MIN floors and playoff rotations), and improving the handling of data limitations and uncertainty.

**Key Changes & Enhancements:**

1.  **Data Sourcing & Timeliness (Phase A - Core Principles, Steps 2, 4):**
    *   **Change:** Increased emphasis on using *priority, timely sources* (official team reports, top-tier insiders via aggregators, established beat writers, Underdog NBA) especially closer to game time for injury/availability updates. Added requirement to note source/time for critical status updates.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses critical failures identified in feedback due to reliance on outdated or less reliable information regarding player availability (e.g., KAT/Payne/McBride, M. Robinson examples). Ensures the most current data forms the prediction base.

2.  **Availability Verification Rigor (Phase A - Step 2):**
    *   **Change:** Made the *targeted dynamic search* for player availability mandatory if *any* uncertainty exists (not just inconsistency), reinforcing the need to actively confirm status rather than assuming.
    *   **Rationale:** Directly tackles the single most significant failure point across feedback – predictions based on incorrect player availability. Increases the likelihood of catching last-minute status changes.

3.  **Preliminary Absence Impact Quantification (Phase A - Step 1):**
    *   **Change:** Enhanced the search guidance to look for more specific metrics related to absences (e.g., impact on USG%, TS%, specific player efficiency changes) and to note sample size if available.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides more concrete, quantitative data for the critical Step 6 game context re-evaluation, improving the ability to judge the *magnitude* of an absence's impact, a key weakness identified.

4.  **Handling Injury Data Uncertainty (Phase A - Step 4):**
    *   **Change:** Added guidance on how to handle situations where a specific injury diagnosis or severity level cannot be found from reliable sources (note as 'Undisclosed' or 'Not Specified').
    *   **Rationale:** Improves robustness and acknowledges real-world data limitations, preventing assumptions when precise information is missing.

5.  **Game Context Re-evaluation Guidance (Phase B - Step 6):**
    *   **Change:** Provided more explicit guidance within the analysis points, specifically highlighting the default assumption of *tightened playoff rotations* (7-8 players) and linking efficiency impact back to Step 1 data. Mandated clearer reasoning when updating/maintaining the prediction.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses feedback showing misjudgments of game flow, blowout potential, and playoff dynamics. Forces a more structured consideration of these factors based on confirmed data.

6.  **Advanced Metrics Flexibility (Phase B - Step 7):**
    *   **Change:** Acknowledged that some advanced metrics (e.g., RAPTOR, EPM) might not be readily accessible via search tools. Prioritized more commonly available, impactful metrics (USG%, TS%, PER) and allowed for noting limitations if specific metrics are unavailable.
    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the potential practical weakness of V3 relying heavily on metrics that might be difficult to retrieve consistently. Ensures the process remains viable even with data constraints.

7.  **Injury Impact Adjustment Granularity (Phase B - Step 8):**
    *   **Change:** Provided more detailed, tiered guidance (Minor/Moderate/Significant examples) on how to adjust MIN/MAX ranges based on injury *severity* and practice status. Included specific instructions for handling 'Undisclosed'/'Not Specified' injuries.
    *   **Rationale:** Aims to improve the consistency and realism of applying injury context to stat predictions, addressing feedback where injury impact was sometimes misjudged (either overestimated or underestimated).

8.  **MIN/MAX Philosophy Reaffirmation & Clarity (Phase B - Step 8):**
    *   **Change:** Reaffirmed the revised MIN philosophy (~70-75% confidence / ~20-25th percentile outcome) and explicitly listed the multiple downside risk factors that **must** be considered (including playoff DNP risk).
    *   **Rationale:** Reinforces the correction for the most pervasive feedback point across all analyses – MIN floors being set too high and failing to capture realistic downside scenarios.

9.  **Playoff Rotation / DNP Risk Emphasis (Phase B - Step 6 & 8):**
    *   **Change:** Increased the emphasis on playoff rotation tightening (defaulting to 7-8 players in Step 6) and the high DNP-CD risk for deep bench players (explicitly required consideration in Step 8 justification and MIN/MAX setting).
    *   **Rationale:** Directly addresses feedback showing frequent misses on bench player predictions (both over-predicting minutes for DNPs and missing unexpected contributors who cracked the tight rotation). Forces a more skeptical approach to deep bench projections in playoffs.

10. **Variance Consideration (Phase B - Step 8):**
    *   **Change:** Added requirement to explicitly identify high-variance players and link the MIN/MAX range width to player variance level and uncertainty.
    *   **Rationale:** Adds nuance to the range setting, acknowledging that some players have wider potential outcomes than others, addressing feedback where both ceilings and floors were sometimes significantly missed for volatile players.

11. **Output Justification Specificity (Output Table):**
    *   **Change:** Made the requirements for the `Analysis Justification` column more specific, demanding explicit reference to the factors analyzed (finalized context, metrics used/unavailable, injury rationale, DNP risk, variance level, MIN/MAX philosophy application).
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures the enhanced analytical steps taken in V4 are transparently documented in the output, improving traceability and accountability.

**Summary:** V4 aims to be a more resilient and realistic prediction prompt by tightening data verification processes, incorporating quantitative absence impact data earlier, refining the crucial game context re-evaluation, providing more nuanced guidance for injury impact and MIN/MAX setting (especially for realistic floors and playoff scenarios), and explicitly handling data uncertainty. These changes directly target the primary weaknesses observed in previous prediction attempts.
